#Conky

My config displays :
- the workspace (Ã  la [neap](http://code.google.com/p/neap/) ),
- the time,
- my battery,
- the network signal,
- the volume, and,
- how many items are in my todolist.

Workspace :
![workspace](http://gniii.org/file/conky_left.png)
The rest :
![widgets](http://gniii.org/file/conky_right.png)

I'm not sure where the icons are from, but I would say that they are frome the "dzen icon set" (but since the wiki isn't available, I can't verify it). I modified them a bit.
