#Reddit userstyle - ALPHA

![reddit](http://gniii.org/img/reddit.png)

This style is, more or less, a port of the Stilig Style for 4chan (https://github.com/RiDeag/Stilig). This userstyle is also based on the userstyle for reddit by falac (https://github.com/phallus/user-styles/tree/master/styles-clean). If you like this userstyle, Go check them out! ;)

###Informations :

- the sidebar is available, when you hover the icon on the top-right.
- I didn't tested this style with RES enabled. So it might not work with this plugin.
- some plugins are perfectly implemented with this style (CRU, NSFW toggle, view images)
- I didn't tested this style with chromium and opera.

###Installation

- in reddit, go to : preferences > display options > disable "allow subreddits to show me custom styles"
- install Stylish for Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/stylish)
- go to the addons page, in the User Style menu, and paste this style.
