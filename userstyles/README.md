#Reddit userstyle - BETA

![reddit](http://gniii.org/img/reddit2.png)

This style is, more or less, a port of the Stilig Style for 4chan (https://github.com/RiDeag/Stilig). This userstyle is also based on the userstyle for reddit by falac (https://github.com/phallus/user-styles/tree/master/styles-clean). If you like this userstyle, Go check them out! ;)

##Informations :

- the sidebar is available, when you hover the icon on the top-right.
- some plugins are perfectly implemented with this style (CRU, NSFW toggle, view images)
- NSFW links are showns with a red border on the left. SFW are blue.

##Warning :

- I didn't tested this style with RES enabled. So it might not work with this plugin.
- I didn't tested this style with chromium and opera.

##Installation

- in reddit, go to : preferences > display options > disable "allow subreddits to show me custom styles", check "show thumbnails next to links" in the media section (and if you have some NSFW subreddit, uncheck the "make safe(r) for work" option)
- install Stylish for Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/stylish)
- create a blank style and paste this style.
